This program is a gateway program for the M17 digital voice mode. It also includes an echo function.

It's operation is similat to D-Star. Commands are issued in the destination field of the transmission. To link to M17-USA module A, use a destination of "M17-USAAL". To unlink use "       U" and to use the echo function use "        E".

This is still work in progress so much may change.

The MMDVM .ini file should have the IP address and port number of the client in
the [M17 Network] settings.

These programs build on 32-bit and 64-bit Linux as well as on Windows using
Visual Studio 2019 on x86 and x64.
